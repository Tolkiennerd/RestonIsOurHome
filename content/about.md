Reston, Virginia is a very affluent city, but there are many residents without homes. These individuals have lived for years in an encampment near the INOVA urgent care center, on the corner of Baron Cameron Avenue and Fountain Drive. Several months ago, it was revealed that these tents would be cleared, so I started this site in order to advocate for their well-being.

The tent residents remain at the encampment for two main reasons. The first is that there is a months-long waitlist to get a bed at the Embry Rucker shelter. The second is that for many unhoused people, a tent in the woods is a superior quality of life than a mat in the shelter, where there is no privacy, no storage for belongings, and where you're only allowed to reside for nighttime hours.

I'm proud to say that the tents have been allowed to remain up to this point.  I believe this was made possible through an outpouring of community support for our unhoused neighbors. Now, the county has opened a temporary overnight shelter for the tent residents. I will be closely monitoring this overnight shelter and asking my friends at the encampment whether it truly does provide privacy and storage, which are the main factors that contribute to tents being a better quality of life than a shelter.
