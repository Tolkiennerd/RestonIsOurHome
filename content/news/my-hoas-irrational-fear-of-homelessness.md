Hello, neighbor!

## TL;DR

üìù Profiling people based on their appearance doesn't help reduce crime  

## Sheltered and Housed
Ever since the Hill encampment closed down, the residents have by and large either been housed or have used the new temporary overnight shelter. While there's still a lack of privacy in the shelter, it remains a safe place to sleep at night for many people.  

Thankfully, a fair number of former Hill residents have now been housed! Several of them now have new stability and independence. Others continue to seek housing vouchers.  

## Roughing It
Some Hill residents are still sleeping outdoors. Some have pitched up tents while others sleep on benches. As of now, nobody's bothering them or reporting them, which is good to hear. However, there is always that risk for anyone sleeping outside, especially now that the Supreme Court decided municipalities can indiscriminately ban unhoused people from sleeping on public property.  

I spoke with some people today who are sleeping outside, and they're doing okay, aside from not having a home. Many of their things have gotten smelly and moldy during last week's rain, but they're otherwise secure. With the weather turning chilly, they're seeking warm things. I've updated the [Needs](/needs) page with the items they've directly asked for. 

## Edgewater's Vendetta Against Unhoused People
I originally created this site to dispel misinformation about Reston's homeless community, and I unfortunately heard more of the same stereotypes repeated by my very own HOA. I live in the Edgewater community, which is right across the street from the wellness center, where many housing insecure people receive services. It's also near the former location of the Hill encampment. There has been some crime (burglary of unlocked cars and patios) which my HOA blames on the nearby homeless population.  

To address these concerns, the HOA organized a meeting with the Reston police. Around 30 neighbors attended. During the meeting, my HOA president claimed that homeless people were trespassing, stealing, breaking into homes, and dealing drugs in our neighborhood. The police major refuted these claims, stating that from police reports, there is no data to back up claims that these crimes are committed by unhoused individuals. He further said that assuming so could result in allowing the true criminals to remain unfound. Another officer present said that he knows the local homeless population and asks them how they're doing whenever he sees them.  

It's important to note that the only reported crimes in my neighborhood are breaking into units and stealing property. These reports are of great concern to me and my neighbors. There were many great suggestions to combat these crimes. Ring cameras, locking patios, locking cars, fences, more lighting, etc. I've left my car unlocked before and gotten stolen from (in a different community). It sucks. I want my neighborhood to implement policies that reduce crime.  

However, some suggestions and assumptions made by the HOA president didn't seem helpful for reducing crime. The president said she saw a man sitting alone on a curb for a long time with a satchel, and she assumed he was waiting for a drug deal. She also said she heard of people walking around with blinking flashlights at night, which she also assumed to be a drug deal. Personally, these assumptions seem like a leap to me. She advocated for reporting anyone who looked suspicious. The assumption is that someone who looks homeless is suspicious. I've been mistaken for a homeless person before. Should I, a homeowner in Edgewater, be reported to the police for trespassing? That's nonsensical.  

On top of all this, these claims that crime rates are linked to homelessness completely ignore the data that crime has upticked in the last month, despite this very last month being the one in which the Hill encampment was cleared. There are objectively fewer homeless people in the area and crime has increased. This data contradicts my HOA president's claim. When I asked her about this, she said she understood my position, but she refused to elaborate further.  

I want crime prevented in my neighborhood. And I want my unhoused friends to be treated with decency. Those two desires don't need to conflict with each other.  

## Stop Profiling, Start Factual Reporting
People experiencing homelessness often are subject to profiling based on their state of dress. It's very unfortunate, and as the police officers during my neighborhood meeting explained, this stereotype can hurt facts-based efforts to find criminals. This is a reality all over America.  

I'm not suggesting that homeless people are saints who don't commit crimes. Obviously, some homeless people commit crimes. When the Hill was still open, there were known troublemakers. Some tent residents would call the cops on others if they stole or acted violently. My friends at the Hill didn't want to live with thieves any more than my neighbors in Edgewater do.  

What's troubling, though, is that homeless people who face hardships every single day also frequently face discrimination based on their appearance. The majority of my neighbors say that they don't want to profile, but they're concerned for their safety. That makes sense. The great news is that you don't have to profile to be safe. In fact, the data shows that such profiling does not reduce crime. Real solutions like locks, cameras, and gates can help.  

Reporting verifiable crimes helps police catch criminals. Reporting someone standing around wearing a patchy shirt does not actually help prevent criminal behavior.

I'm reaching out to organizations to help those who are sleeping outside. Hopefully I'll hear back soon, since chilly weather is upon us.  

Thanks,
