Hello, neighbor!

It's been a while since my last message, and a lot has happened! It appears that the county has heard our requests and has delayed clearing the tents. This wouldn't be possible without so much outpouring of community support! Many people living in the encampment would be in much worse situations if the county indiscriminately evicted everyone, so this delay is great news. Eventually, the tents will be cleared, but there is no set date on that for now.

There's always so much going on at the encampment (which we call the Hill), so I thought I'd start a semi-regular (around twice a month) newsletter to keep you updated. You're receiving this email because you had signed up for updates on the Reston Is Our Home website, and if you'd like to stop receiving these newsletters, then reply to this email saying you'd like to unsubscribe.

Without further ado, here's what's happening at the Hill!

## TL;DR
ü•µ Everyone is feeling the heat -- they're always asking for cold water!  
‚ôªÔ∏è We cleaned up plenty of trash last week and hauled it to the dump  
üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è The Supreme Court cruelly ruled that cities can fine and/or arrest homeless people for sleeping outside even if shelters are full  
üëó My friend Rosa Simon received lots of donations of women's clothes, which helped out ladies on the Hill  
üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Volunteers can't park in the INOVA parking lot anymore because of increased security...  
üéí My church (with help from Rosa) donated backpacks filled with useful items for the heat to our friends on the streets in Herndon

## It's HOT
You've felt this scorching weather every time you step outside -- but for our friends at the Hill, the heat never stops. I'm almost always lugging water bottles up there whenever I visit, and they never turn down water. Adding to the difficulty of the heat, the Reston Library has closed down for a few months due to renovations, which means that a common place where the tent residents could cool down is now unavailable. Hopefully the weather turns back soon.

## Trash Day!

Every so often, I do trash day at the Hill. This involves renting a U-Haul truck, organizing folks at the Hill to bag trash, putting everything in the truck, and taking it all to the dump. Trash days are always lots of work, but they're very rewarding. The Hill can get pretty messy, especially since these people don't have access to (legal) options for dumping trash bags. Last trash day, we totally stuffed the U-Haul, and we could have put in more if there was space. I'll need to head back and do it again, probably sometime next week.

## Grant's Pass v. Johnson
Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court ruled in the case Grant's Pass v. Johnson that cities can fine and/or arrest homeless people for sleeping outside on public property, even if all shelters are full. This decision cruelly hurts a vulnerable population, and it also lacks common sense. Where else are people without homes supposed to sleep? The apparent implication is that they shouldn't exist, which makes no sense. Housing is more expensive than ever, and homelessness rates are skyrocketing. Criminalizing homelessness is not the answer. I pray that Fairfax County will find a more logical and compassionate response to homelessness. As one of the wealthiest counties in America, we can do better.

## So many women's clothes!

The Hill received ten bags of women's clothing from Rosa Simon, who is an absolute powerhouse of a woman. It's impossible to list off everything she does, but suffice it to say, she spends most of her life helping our unhoused and low-income neighbors. Many of these clothes went to women on the Hill, and the rest (winter attire) is in storage for when the weather gets chilly. She also has delivered homemade food, toiletries, feminine products, and much more to the Hill. Check out her Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100030791725527&mibextid=LQQJ4d" target="_blank">Made In Reston</a>, to see everything she's up to!

## New INOVA Security
The Hill is right next to the INOVA Urgent Care center, so I and other volunteers use their parking lot when visiting. Due to a recent security concern, INOVA posted a 24-hour security guard in the parking lot. Without getting into too much detail, I think it's a valid security concern, and I don't think the guard is an overreaction. However, as part of the guard's job, they are supposed to tow any cars whose drivers park there without hospital business. I asked the head of security (who I've had a good relationship with) if this includes volunteers at the Hill, and he said it does. This is really annoying and unfortunate. I'm hoping to work closer with INOVA to get our parking back.

## Backpacks for Herndon Day Laborers

This last announcement isn't related to the Hill, but I can't help from bragging about my church! Rosa Simon, who I mentioned above, works closely with the low-income immigrant community in Herndon, many of whom are homeless. They're hard-working men who are always looking for day jobs. Rosa has put on several backpack drives in order to give the day laborers something to carry their belongings in, and she suggests filling them up with items that help with the heat, like sunscreen, floppy hats, and extra shirts. My congregation, <a href="https://www.herndonfriendsmeeting.org" target="_blank">Herndon Friends Meeting</a>, heard about this drive and enthusiastically participated. We raised money for backpacks and supplies, then after worship one Sunday, we filled them up with outdoor essentials. Rosa and I then delivered all the backpacks to eager recipients. Now, many of these men have a better chance of finding a day job while keeping their belongings close and staying cool.

Those are some highlights from the last several weeks! Thanks again for your support, and feel free to email me with any questions you have.

Thank you,  
Matthew
